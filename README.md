Languages used so far:

| Day | Language          | Rating | Comment |
| ---:| ----------------- |:------:| ------- |
|  01 | Haskell           |  -7/10 | never again |
|  02 | Scala             |   6/10 | it feels like python, but it's java, but it's also a scripting language that's complied |
|  03 | Go                |   8/10 | file reading is a bit messy, and foreach loops are odd |
|  04 | Ruby              |   9/10 | although i spent a while researching, i found that it comes with a lot of useful features |
|  05 | C                 |   7/10 | - |
|  06 | Rust              |   8/10 | i quite like the compiler being fancy and suggesting what to do (tho sometimes wrong), and the language seems to be on par with python in terms of level |
|  07 | Kotlin            |   8/10 | i like the feel of Kotlin, the .filter / .map / .foreach syntax is a bit odd, but readable |
|  08 | R                 |   6/10 | R is definitely a data analysis lang, not made for intcode computers |
|  09 | Perl              |   7/10 | a decent scripting lang, but the Perl plugin for IJ IDEA doesn't work like i expect it to. |
|  10 | Groovy            |   6/10 | It's basically java but without typed variables? that's about it |
|  11 | Clojure           |   4/10 | 1) i have absolutely no clue what it could be used for<br>2) it's another java wrapper language thing<br>3) the 'polish notation' syntax is highly confusing, this is the first lang in AoC2020  i've had to write comments for, cause i had to remember how what works |
|  12 | Common Lisp       |   3/10 | it is <ins>not</ins> the same as Clojure; the syntax might be the same and )))))))))), but it's much different |
|  13 | Pharo SmallTalk   |   5/10 | running it was interesting... i did everything in Pharo, which is a _VM?_ for SmallTalk, and i wrote everything in it's sandbox, copied it into a file via sublime 3 |
|  14 | Erlang (escript)  |   5/10 | eh, lot's of recursion, etc |
|  15 | Elixir            |   8/10 | quite a nice language, imo, was super easy to get going in it |
|  16 | Bash              |   7/10 | slow |
|  17 | D                 |   -    | _(rating & comment coming tomorrow)_ |
